# Portfolio-Optimization-and-Efficient-Frontier-Model
Uses MPT to create an efficient frontier and provides user the highest Sharpe ratio portfolio weights based on their chosen stocks

There are three different script options

1. Minimum Varience portfolio:
  User can select three tickers to create an efficient frontier and select the number of simulated portfolios used to find 
  the weights for the minimum varience portfolio(MVP). The efficient frontier and MVP will shown as a scatter plot. (minimum varience is the portfolio        
  where the volatility(risk) is the smallest irrespective of returns.
  
2. Simple 5 stock portfolio optimizer:
    Does the same as the first portfolio execpt it takes five stocks and provides the optimal weights for the stocks in the portfolio. Dones not plot a   
    graph.
    
3. Efficient frontier: The big, good one.
    This script provides the user a graph of the efficient frontier and plots both the minimum varience portfolio as well as the most efficient portfolio 
    (highest sharpe ratio - The Sharpe ratio seeks to characterize how well the return of an asset compensates the investor for the risk taken. When 
    comparing two assets, the one with a higher Sharpe ratio appears to provide better return for the same risk, which is usually attractive to investors.) 
    
    The user can specify any number of tickers to add to the portfolio as well as the number of simulated portfolios to use.
